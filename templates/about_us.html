  	<h3>About Flawlessly Taboo</h3>
	<p>Flawlessly Taboo is more than a lingerie brand, it's our passion. For years, I searched for the right lingerie. Something that would enable me to embrace my sensual side without feeling like I was attempting to hide a part of myself. I found many amazing lingerie lines, but every one of them fell short when it came to meeting my specific anatomical needs. That's how I came to realize that I simply had to develop my own and the idea for Flawlessly Taboo was born! </p>
	<p>All of our products are designed and handmade in the United States by a transgender woman that understands your need to feel sexy without sacrificing comfort.</p>
	<p>I personally design and manufacture each piece to ensure that you will feel your sexiest while having the freedom and comfort that your body craves.</p>
	<p>Our hope is that you enjoy these products just as much as I enjoy creating them for you.</p>
